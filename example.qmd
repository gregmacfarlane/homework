##### A basic problem {.homework}
Define *mobility*. 

::: {.homework-key}

Mobility is the ability people have to travel over distances afforded by
transportation systems. Often modes and facilities that can provide high
mobility --- expressways and high-speed rail, for example --- provide poor
*accessibility*, or the ability to reach destinations.

##### A less basic problem {.homework}
A highway has a jam density of 120 vehicles per mile and a free flow speed of 75
miles per hour. What is the capacity of the highway assuming the Greenshields' 
traffic flow model?

::: {.homework-key}

In Greenshield's model, the maximum flow rate is 
$$ q_m = \frac{v_f k_j}{4}$$
So, for this question, the capacity is 
$$ \frac{120 \times 75}{4} = 2250$$
vehicles per hour.
